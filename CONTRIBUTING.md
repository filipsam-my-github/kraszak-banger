## Style Guidelines

To ensure consistency across the codebase, please follow these style guidelines:

### Variables
- Use **lowercase** for variable names.
- Separate words with underscores for better readability (e.g., `example_variable`).

### Files names
- Use **lowercase** for file names (e.g., `example_file`).

### Classes
- Use **PascalCase** for class names (e.g., `MyClassName`).

### Functions
- Use **PascalCase** for function names (e.g., `MyFunctionName`).

### Preferred language
- As it is standart in industry to write code in English so **Preferred is English** in all cases.
- That means TODO comments, docstrings, comments, files, ect.
- Because this is a Polish project **Polish is acceptable in TODO comments** as there are temporary anyway.


### General
- Maintain consistent indentation (e.g., 2 spaces or 4 spaces, as applicable).
- Write clear and descriptive names for all variables, classes, and functions.
- Avoid using abbreviations unless they are well-established (e.g., `URL`, `HTML`).
- Document complex or non-obvious parts of the code with comments or with documentation string(docstring).

Following these standards helps keep the code clean, readable, and easy to maintain.
